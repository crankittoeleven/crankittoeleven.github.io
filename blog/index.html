                    <h2>Beat Disruption and Win Customers—How Retailers Mitigate Delivery Challenges to Meet Expectations</h2>
                    <p>
                        No brands can predict the future, but they can take steps to mitigate disruptions and meet customer expectations this peak season.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Disruptions continue in 2022. Logistics professionals expect a chaotic peak season. Fifty-one percent expect this year to be worse than 2021</li>
                        <li>Many retailers planned to ship peak season inventory at the end of June—weeks earlier than usual</li>
                        <li>Even in the midst of economic disruptions, consumer expectations remain high. Flexe’s 2022 Omnichannel Retail Report revealed consumer expectations continue to increase for eCommerce delivery. They want their orders—fast and free</li>
                        <li>The Flexe Institute asked retailers how they mitigate current supply chain disruptions. They named three categories: improve fulfillment networks and manage inventory, diversify logistics service providers and manage customer expectations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Retailers prepare for peak in the midst of continuous disruption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Retailers battle supply chain crises while they prepare for 2022’s peak season. And many planned to ship peak season inventory at the end of June—weeks earlier than usual.
                        <br /><br/>
                        Meanwhile, shopping patterns shift due to rising inflation and economic uncertainty. Consumers favored cheaper alternatives in some categories as economic concerns grew. Many opted to purchase services over goods. Americans spent nearly $44 billion less on goods in May but $76 billion more on services.
                        <br /><br/>
                        So how do retailers successfully navigate chaotic supply chains and shifting customer expectations? No brand can predict the future, but they can take steps to mitigate disruptions and meet consumer expectations this peak season.
                        <br /><br/>
                        In Q1 2022, the Flexe Institute conducted two surveys to understand changes in consumer behavior and retailer priorities. The data revealed three strategic categories retailers leverage to mitigate supply chain disruption. Peak season will put these strategies to the test.

                    <h2>Current economic conditions shift consumer expectations and purchase habits</h2>
                    <p>
                        Americans spent less in May 2022 due to inflation, increased fuel prices and recession fears. In May, consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent, down from 0.9 percent growth a month earlier—a departure from years of robust growth.
                        Consumers shifted spending to cheaper alternatives in some categories and opted to spend more on services than goods. Americans spent nearly $44 billion less on goods in May but $76 billion more on services.
                        As retailers prepare for peak, an uncertain economic future makes demand forecasts and inventory purchases harder.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forty-five percent of retailers don’t offer fast shipping because it makes total costs too high.</li>
                        <li>Likewise, 50% of retailers skip free shipping options due to outbound transportation costs.</li>
                        <li>Thirty-eight percent claim embedded shipping costs, where a portion or the full shipping cost is rolled into the product’s price tag, will make total costs too high.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With fuel costs accelerating, retailers now face a double bind: lose customers due to suboptimal delivery options or lose them due to higher costs per order.
                        <br /><br />
                        Minimizing final mile costs requires optimized logistics networks. Thirty-four percent of retailers don’t offer fast shipping because they don’t have fulfillment centers close to customers.
                        <br /><br />
                        Traditional supply chains aren’t designed to change quickly—or cheaply. Retailers can add warehouse nodes to their networks, but it’s a costly strategy. The industrial vacancy rate rests at record lows. The national average industrial rent hit $8.93 per square foot in April 2022, up 11.8% year-over-year. Increased industrial construction provides some future relief—though not in 2022.
                        <br /><br />
                        In short: the challenge to minimize costs and improve delivery promises is likely to worsen before it gets better.
                        In Q1 2022, the Flexe Institute conducted two surveys to understand changes in consumer behavior and retailer priorities. The data revealed three strategic categories retailers leverage to mitigate supply chain disruption. Peak season will put these strategies to the test.

                    <p>
                        Consistent, fast delivery promises require optimized supply chain networks: The right inventory in the right locations at the right time.
                        <br /><br />
                        Brands utilize a variety of strategies to optimize networks and improve inventory management, as the 2022 Omnichannel Retail Report revealed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Forty-four percent diversified their supplier networks to navigate disruption. Half consider further diversification to navigate 2022’s peak season.</li>
                        <li>Forty percent diversified their parcel network and partnerships. As 2022’s peak season approaches, 44% consider further diversification.</li>
                        <li>Twenty-eight percent leverage short-term warehousing to flexibly expand and optimize networks. And 45% consider short-term warehousing in the future.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Manage customer expectations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Successful eCommerce selling requires transparent communication. Customers want to know what they can buy and when it will be delivered. Stockouts and delays alienate customers. Seventy percent of consumers planned to switch retailers or brands to avoid stockouts. And 72% skip repeat purchases due to late deliveries.
                        <br /><br />
                        If brands can’t meet delivery promises, retailers are responsible for updating their customers on changes and delays.

                    <h2>Retailers can fight back against disruption</h2>
                    <p>
                        Disruptions continue in 2022. Logistics professionals expect a chaotic peak season. Fifty-one percent expect this year to be worse than 2021.
                        <br /><br />
                        But retailers can fight back. Top brands optimize their fulfillment networks, diversify their logistics service providers and implement communication strategies to meet customer expectations—even when unforeseen issues arise.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Sixty-nine percent implemented strategies to communicate delivery promises and order visibility to customers.
                            <br /><br />
                            Strong communication strategies reinforce customer trust. The 2021 peak season saw out-of-stock messages increase by 172% compared to 2020, and an astonishing 360% compared to 2019. In that context, nearly a third of top 100 retailers listed “cut-off” shipping dates on their homepages in 2021. Of these brands, 81% listed their cut-off dates on or before December 20.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sixty-four percent increased sales via their website, and 50% increased sales via third-party retailers.
                            <br /><br />
                            Customers expect a great eCommerce experience, with a strong delivery promise advertised at checkout. Brands with both fast and free delivery options will continue to win online sales.
